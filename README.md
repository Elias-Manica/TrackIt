## About this Project

This is a Single-Page Application that stores the habits that people intend to adopt to optimize their routines. It shows its gradual evolution and returns whether all the habits of the day were performed or not. Below are the implemented features:

- Sing Up
- Login
- Create a habit
- Delete a habit
- Mark habit as completed
- Uncheck completed habit
- Calendar with the history of completed habit days
